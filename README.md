A swiss army knife for minecraft servers.

## pap is close to 1.0 ðŸŽ‰

pap is now feature complete (for now) and just needs testing & code reviewing.

If you want, try installing pap and messing around with it.

If you actually manage to break it, [open an issue](https://github.com/talwat/pap/issues).

Or, make a PR.

## Examples

### Download the latest papermc jarfile

`pap download paper`

### Sign the EULA

`pap sign`

### Generate a script to run the jarfile

`pap script --jar server.jar`

### Turn off pvp

`pap properties set pvp false`

### Install worldedit

`pap plugin install worldedit`

## Why though?

pap has a few purposes:

- To simplify some of the common tasks you need to do when creating or managing a server (such as when you download/update the server jar.)
- To easily and automatically verify the jars you download to avoid bad issues down the line.
- To provide an easy CLI to do common tasks like changing server.properties and signing EULA, for usage in scripts.
- To quickly install plugins directly from their sources.

## Install

### Build Dependencies

If you are obtaining pap from source, you will need these dependencies:

- [Go](https://go.dev/) 1.18 or later
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software))

### Arch linux

> **Info**
> The AUR build might not have the latest version of pap, but it may be more stable.

If you wish, pap can be installed from the AUR:

```sh
yay -S pap
```

### Ubuntu

Install [Pacstall](https://github.com/pacstall/pacstall#installing), then run:
```bash
pacstall -I pap
```

### Unix

#### Unix - From Releases

You can go to the [latest release](https://github.com/talwat/pap/releases/latest)
and download the fitting binary for your system from there.

pap is available on most architectures and operating systems, so you will rarely need to compile it from source.

##### Unix - System wide from releases

```sh
sudo install -Dm755 pap* /usr/bin/pap
```

##### Unix - Local from releases

> **Warning**
> You may see an error that pap wasn't found, if you see this you may not have `~/.local/bin/` in your PATH.
> See [common issues](#local-installation-not-found) on how to add it.

```sh
install -Dm755 pap* ~/.local/bin/pap
```

#### Unix - From Source

> **Warning**
> `pap update` downloads and installs a binary, it does not compile it from source.
> If you need to compile pap from source, don't use `pap update`.

First, clone pap:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/talwat/pap
cd pap
```

Switch to the latest tag _(optional)_:

```sh
git tag # get all tags
git checkout <tag>
```

And then build:

```sh
make
```

Finally, move it into your binary directory:

##### Unix - System wide from source

```sh
sudo make install PREFIX=/usr
```

##### Unix - Local from source

> **Warning**
> You may see an error that pap wasn't found, if you see this you may not have `~/.local/bin/` in your PATH.
> See [common issues](#local-installation-not-found) on how to add it.

```sh
make install
```

### Windows

pap **does** work on windows, but windows has a ~~bad~~ different way to CLI apps.

#### Windows - From Releases _(recommended)_

If you want to download from releases, download the fitting windows exe and [put it into path](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4822400/register-an-exe-so-you-can-run-it-from-any-command-line-in-windows#:~:text=Go%20to%20%22My%20computer%20%2D%3E,exe%20's%20directory%20into%20path.).

#### Windows - From Source

First, clone pap:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/talwat/pap
cd pap
```

Switch to the latest tag _(optional)_:

```sh
git tag # get all tags
git checkout <tag>
```

And then build:

```sh
# Use `make` if you have it, otherwise:

mkdir -vp build
go build -o build
```

Finally, [put it into path](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4822400/register-an-exe-so-you-can-run-it-from-any-command-line-in-windows#:~:text=Go%20to%20%22My%20computer%20%2D%3E,exe%20's%20directory%20into%20path.).

### Common issues

#### Local installation not found

Usually this is because `~/.local/bin` is not in PATH.

You can add `~/.local/bin` to PATH through your shell:

##### Bash

```sh
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

##### Zsh

```sh
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

##### Fish

Look at the [fish docs](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/tutorial.html#path) for more detailed instructions.

```sh
fish_add_path $HOME/.local/bin
```

## Updating pap

> **Note**
> This will only work if you are running version 0.11.0 or higher. If not, just reinstall using the install guide.

If you used a release and followed the install guide, you should be able to simply run:

```sh
sudo pap update
```

or if you did a local install:

```sh
pap update
```

## Uninstalling pap

Simply delete the binary file you installed. pap does not create any files that you do not explicitly
tell it to.

So, if you did a system wide install do:

```sh
sudo rm /usr/bin/pap
```

or if you did a local install:

```sh
rm ~/.local/bin/pap
```
